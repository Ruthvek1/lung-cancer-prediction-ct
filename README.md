Deep learning-based lung cancer prediction system using CT scan images for early detection and diagnosis.
# ü´Å Lung Cancer Prediction Using CT Scans

This project implements a deep learning model for early-stage lung cancer prediction using CT scan images. It aims to assist in the diagnosis of lung cancer by providing accurate classification results from CT scans using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## üìå Features

- Preprocessing and normalization of CT scan images
- Model training using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Accuracy and loss tracking during training
- Prediction of cancerous vs non-cancerous scans
- Simple and clean code structure

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of CT scan images, typically sourced from open medical repositories such as:

- [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)
- [LIDC-IDRI](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI)

You must download and preprocess the dataset accordingly before training.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
